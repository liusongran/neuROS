\section{Basic knowledge about MSP430 LEA}
The LEA is a 32-bit hardware engine designed for operations that involve vector-based signal processing, such as FIR, IIR, and FFT without CPU intervention. The LEA supports multiple commands, which are issued by CPU. The LEA performs the operation without CPU intervention and triggers an interrupt when the operation is complete. The LEA accesses the LEA data memory, which is used for input data, output data, and the parameter blocks. And the LEA data memory is also accessible by the CPU and the DMA. The Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Library for MSP Microcontrollers offers easy-to-use APIs that use the functions of the LEA and provide a high-level environment to use the LEA in various applications.
